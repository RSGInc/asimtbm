asimtbm
=======

asimtbm is a collection of trip-based modeling tools 
implemented in the `ActivitySim framework <https://github.com/activitysim/activitysim>`_.  Currently asimtbm
contains an aggregate destination choice model and a matrix/table balancing tool.  As an activitysim 
package, asimtbm exposes its calculations in CSV files that contain pandas and numpy
expressions that operate on the input data tables and matrices. This design avoids
having to modify Python code when making changes to the benefit calculations.  Users are therefore strongly
encouraged to refer to the `ActivitySim documentation <https://activitysim.github.io/activitysim/>`_ for
more information about how asimtbm works and operates.
