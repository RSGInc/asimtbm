asimtbm is ...

asimtbm is implemented in the `ActivitySim framework <https://github.com/activitysim/activitysim>`_ and
therefore exposes its calculations in CSV files that contain pandas and numpy
expressions that operate on the input data tables and matrices. This design avoids
having to modify Python code when making changes to the benefit calculations.  Users are therefore strongly
encouraged to refer to the `ActivitySim documentation <https://activitysim.github.io/activitysim/>`_ for
more information about how asimtbm works and operates.
